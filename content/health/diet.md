Alright, so, this is the diet plan I've developed for myself. It's not going to work for everyone, but might work to give you some ideas.

# Goals 

Ok, so, we're going to use BMI as a tool to give us a target weight. As everyone knows, BMI fails to account for anlot of variables: Muscle/fat ratio, torso/leg ratio etc. Generally it should only be used as an indicator to flag something that needs further investigation.

We're going to use it anyway. My reasoning is that I'm not a muscular person, I don't particularly plan to build muscle, thus it should give us good general bounds for our weight - as the muscle will bias your BMI to be higher than it should.

For people my height and age, the range is ~65-85kg. So we'll aim for about 5kg under the mid point, assuming when we settle into eating regularly we'll gain back 5kg or so.

Goal weight: 70-75kg.

# Energy Requirements

Okay, so to work out energy requirements we need to calculate BMR (basal metabolic rate) or TDEE (total daily energy expenditure). Both of these are flawed in similar ways to BMI, in that they don't take many variables into account. Generally I plan energy intake goals between BMR, as it's independent of daily exercise, and my estimated on TDEE*

For someone my height and weight, my BMR is 7,750-8,500kj and at my typical exercise level that's a TDEE of 9250kj-10,000kj. The ranges are because I'm trans fem, so my actual energy use is probably somewhere between these numbers, I air towards the lower female limits however as my understanding is that the difference is mostly due to muscle and temperature regulation (I am weak and cold).

We'll assume a BMR of 8,000kj and TDEE of 9,500kj.

* This is probably dangerous and bad

# Energy Intake Goal

1kg of fat is about 37,000kj. In order to loose that I need to have a net energy intake deficit of that amount over a specific period of time. For example, if I wanted to loose 1kg in a week, that would require me to eat 5,250kj less than the energy I expend per day (somewhere between BMR and my TDEE, probably). 

To be blunt and clear, 1kg a week probably isn't possible at my weight or to most people without fasting entire days or relying on exercise & metabolic shock (increasing energy use and decreasing intake, before your basal metabolic rate adapts to the more constrained energy intake). This requires medical supervision, so I strongly recommend against it unless you've got it. 

We're still going to be aiming high though, I believe I should be able to maintain a 0.5kg loss per week, which is a deficit of 2,750kj. Using my BMR and TDEE that gives us a range of 5,250kj-6,750kj. Again we'll take it at about 250kj above the lower bound, and 250kj lower than the upper bound.

That gives us a daily energy intake goal of 5,500kj. With an upper bound of 6,500kj.

# Energy Intake Tracking

To prevent myself going spare counting kilojoules and microoptimizing, I have developed an approach that works for me, mostly.

Firstly energy intake is measured in fixed 500kj "intake units". This means that my energy intake goal should be between 11 and 13 intake units. 

Second, <100kj rounds down anything over rounds up. This is to minimise the impact of having to go over my daily goal by a little bit. Say I round 3 meals up by 200kj each, that's a hidden deficit of 600kj/day which reduces the impact of a 1500kj cafe coffee by half. I do my best not to use it, of course.

Third, if I'm hungry, I eat. The goal here isn't to crash my blood sugar levels, be hangry and faint whenever I standup. I'll eat if I need it. It's important to differentiate "needing it" and wanting emotional food support. I also make sure to consider if I can just have a meal early instead.

# Nutritional Needs

## Protein 

Alright. Nutrients are important when dieting, especially at an extreme level like this. Biggest one we need to consider is Protien intake. This is important during weightloss, apparently, as you don't want your body to canabalize muscle mass to meet energy intake goals. I'm not certain how having good protien intake minimizes this, perhaps unrepaired muscle is canabalized with priority. I'm not certain.

There's a lot of completing calculations, WHO has a "safe lower limit". We'll be aiming just above it. This is another calculation like all the rest that doesn't take into account any variables. So for this specific one we'll be selecting protein based on someone healthy at my target weight. The WHO lower limit for my goal weight is 62g.

Some common protein sources, per 100g:
- Supermarket Chicken Breast. 20g protien. 450kj. $1.00 AUD
- Yoghurt. 9g. 250kj. $1.00 AUD
- Almonds. 20g. 2500kj. $2.50 AUD
- Mozzarella. 23g. 1300kj. $2.00.

Chocken values are for uncooked, as far as I know. Cooking will reduce a lot of water out. But it's good to know as I'll be working with raw breasts.

Nuts are pretty energy dense, so they're only really good as a side serving. 

Soft cheeses are very high in protien. Things like ricotta are better, but I'm not a fan. Going with a fat reduced mozzarella can reduce the energy intake by about 200kj, and increase protien by 7g, which is definitely worth it if you get along with it.

Protein powder I've exclused because it's kinda pointless. It's fully equivalent to chicken breast in terms of energy in protein, but costs significantly more and requires you to drink large amounts of it. It might work if you can't precook meals, but, it's really just not worth the price.

Just an example meal with my total protein intake: 
- 200g chicken breast (40g protein, 1000kj, $2)
- 75g fat reduced mozzarella (22g protein, 825kj, $1.5)
- 75g serve frozen mixed veg (1g protein, 95kj, $0.4)

Total: 63g protien, 1920kj (round to 2000kj), $4

Obviously this doesn't account for cooking oil, seasoning etc. But this just demonstrates that it's possible in this diet. I'd rather a slightly smaller meal, and include yoghurt at lunch.

## Water

Drink 2L of water a day. That's important for maintaining an stable weight for measuring, as it reduces how much water weight your body holds onto.

## Others

Obviously you don't just need protien. You also need carbs, fats, salt, calcium, amino acids, fibre and various vitamins. We'll end up with plenty of carbs and fats due to the body metabolizing it's own fat andsalt isn't a worry in the modern food world so we don't need to worry strongly here.

Theoretically we should be trying to get nutrients and vitamins from veggies. But honestly, I can't be bothered. I'll likely pick up a calcium + vitamin D supplement, to ensure bone density, and maybe a multivitamin if I can find one that actually meets some daily needs.

If you're eating meat, amino acids shouldn't be a huge worry. If you're not, or want to be sure, nutritional yeast is a good option. It's packed with basically every amino acid you require.

# Meals

Given the budget of 5,500kj, it's going to be easier to take an intermittent fasting (IF) approach. This more or less involves skipping breakfast and extending your fast after dinner until lunch.

My typical lunch is between 1,500kj and 2,000kj, and dinner between 2,000kj and 2,500kj. This leaves us a budget of about 1000kj of non-meal intke. This can include things like coffee with milk, almonds, ice cream. This non-meal intake must be taken or rolled into meals, otherwise the diet will be quite unheathy. Sometimes I'll break the IF and have breakfast using 1,500kj (100kj from today's budget and 500kj from tomorrow's) if I feel like I need it (bad sleep, unwell etc.)

# Treats 

If I get through an entire week following my energy intake goals, I'll accrue a treat meal. Basically this just meals I can get a small fast food meal sometime, ignoring my energy intake limits.

# Exercise 

Do it for health, not weightloss. The body is great at adapting to energy expenditure though physical exercise. Initially you will see additional weight loss, but as it becomes routine your body will push you to sleep longer, take easier modes of transport, lean on things, eat more and even reduce your body temperature (metabolism) to compensate. Increased muscle mass can increase your BMR, but you're currently cutting weight which isn't ideal for building muscle. 

Time your exercise before a meal to help reduce excess eating, maybe budget for a 500kj snack of nuts, make sure you're getting protien and keep hydrated. And to be clear, it's not that exercise doesn't increase your energy expenditure. It's that it's not consistent or predictable. Monitor it over a few months, and you'll be able to make adjustments to your intake plans, but unfortunately it's not as simple as I cycled for 2hrs, I can have a 2000kj burger.

# Monitoring 

Monitoring is important. It's recommended to weigh yourself weekly, on the same day, in the morning before eating or showering. This is to ensure a clear consistent reading. From this information you can determine if you're loosing weight too fast or too slow over the course of a month, and make adjustments.

Initially there will be additional weightlosss, due to the shedding of water weight. This can be on the scale of a few kg, so don't be suprised.

It's important to not be too excited (and reward yourself too much) or be disheartened. This is a long-term game of averages.

# Finishing the diet

Obviously. 5500kj is not enough to sustain my existence permanently. At my height that'd put me at a meager 45kg stable, which is classified as severely underweight. But as well, going back to my previous diet before dieting will just result in me gaining my weight back.

What's important here is to slowly transition to eating the BMR of your healthy target weight over a couple weeks, then to the estimated TDEE, keeping track of weight gain. For me this range is around 6,750kj-8,000kj. You should have some initial weight gain due to metabolic adaption, but it shouldn't be rapid unless you rush things. You need to remember that your body has basically been in "starvation mode" (read as "efficiency mode") for months or a even year or more and it'll take a while for your body to get used to things again.

From there, it's a matter of just trying to average what you find your requirements to be, monitor.monthly and maybe diet a few months a year to shed any winter weight you might pick up.

# Evidence 

Case study of 1, this did work for me. Though I didn't allow myself to transition until I lost about 35kg, big motivator.

I need to do it again sadly, you tend to eat a lot more than you should when you're simultaneously starting estrogen, dealing with a changed emotional landscape, dating and getting married.

Finding it a lot harder now, especially with the lower muscle mass meaning that my energy requirements are lower, and thus requires more strict diet.
